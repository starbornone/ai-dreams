The beginnings of some simple economic concepts in ["To see a world in a 3D array and an economy in a function"](https://aidreams.world/world-economy-function) didn't get enough attention. My criticisms of some existing measures focus on the fact that they are not scientific - that is, models based on them cannot predict. So I'd like for us to take a moment and talk a bit more about generating value, price, and profit under our economic system in a more scientific manner before we move on. What is that system? Capitalism.

The central components of capitalism that differentiate it from earlier systems lie in its ability to draw people together to produce, with two essential characteristics.

First, most people who work under capitalism do not control the tools and the raw materials used to create commodities. These are known as the *means of production*. Instead, they work for a wage provided by their employer. Meanwhile, those who own the means of production are known as *capitalists*.

Second, unlike in previous societies, people do not typically use what they produce. Instead, the goods and services they provide get sold on the market. So it's no longer a case of consuming what's necessary and then selling the rest - the entire process focuses on production for the market. As a result, such products are known as *commodities*, and everything that goes into creating them is known as *capital*.

Not only that, but markets involve competition between rival capitalists. They are united in their desire to retain control over the means of production and pump wealth out of workers. But they are also divided among themselves over who will have the most significant share of the profits generated and the markets created. Their rivalry has important implications for how the system develops over time, for example, increasing importance in obtaining market share and attention economy.

Last time, I also mentioned that while supply and demand can affect a commodity's price, it's not an effective model for it cannot predict. There also remains the issue of what those prices fluctuate around. That's why we have the *labour theory of value*. It was first developed by some of the most influential classical economists then refined and built upon over time as more critics and theorists of political economy delved into the matter.

To get into the labour theory of value, we must first determine the two different types of value an item has.

Firstly, the *use-value* measures what that commodity is useful for, for example, eating a bread loaf, sitting upon a chair, and threatening or murdering many people with a gun. The use-value of an item only becomes a reality when that item is used or consumed. However, it's not easy to compare the usefulness of things directly to each other - there is another type of value for that.

The second type of value is *exchange-value*, representing the amount one could exchange to obtain a certain number of these items. For example, in exchanging corn and iron, we see a third measurement used in society by which we can facilitate their exchange: currency.

So how then are we able to compare such items at all? Remember that we aim for a scientific attempt at understanding the world. Therefore we cannot merely stop at the thought that something is worth what another is willing to pay for it. Vague concepts are no way to gauge the world and its economies.

Instead, we can look for something familiar to all commodities: the labour that went into them. In ["To see a world in a 3D array and an economy in a function"](https://aidreams.world/world-economy-function), where I attempt to turn some real-world economics into game-like terms, I called this Worker Effort. However, it has a proper name - *socially necessary labour time* - representing the particular duration of labour time taken to create the item.

Now I've worn many hats in my professional life: front-end developer, back-end developer, database designer, system analyst, content manager, salesperson, and so on. But never have I made a chair that didn't come in an IKEA package. So if I were to make a chair and it took three days, that doesn't mean my chair is worth more.

What socially necessary labour time refers to is the average across society. That is the amount of time spent under normal conditions, with an average degree of skill and intensity.

Because we live in a world of nation-states, we can view them individually to compare them and see how, for example, technology dramatically affects the potential output of an individual worker.

For example, compare the agriculture industry of India to the United States. [In 2008](https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/India/United-States/Agriculture#2008), there were 261.63 million farmworkers in India and 2.67 million in the United States. They were able to work on 1.8 million sq. km and 4.14 million sq. km, respectively. The US has twice the agricultural land as India; however, they manage to work it with 98 times fewer people. Of course, there are many other factors to consider here. Still, it does stand out that something else is facilitating the [increase in productivity and reducing the labour requirement](https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2020/03/05/look-agricultural-productivity-growth-united-states-1948-2017) in the US.

Is it then fair to compare the productivity of those in India to the US? Only insofar as it is to recognise what another country may need to boost their ability to produce enough to meet the needs of their people - that is, their sustainability without dependence on the outside world. However, that's a matter for another time.

Either way, we must still include labour outside of the human element in our calculations. In ["To see a world in a 3D array and an economy in a function"](https://aidreams.world/world-economy-function), we looked at the following example:

> In a service such as changing the tyres on a car, the time it takes for the employee to change the tyres will be the Worker Effort. In this example, we're looking at the Business that did the tyre changing using tyres bought from another Business, and not the Business that made the tyre. For each Business, we only consider the Worker Effort of its employees and not the goods or services it has purchased from other Businesses.

> Therefore, in constructing a car, the Business sources tyres from another company by purchasing them. Then the Worker Effort that went into creating those tyres does not count for this Business. However, the car will most likely be assembled by other machines that were assembled and are both run and maintained by Workers. Because running them usually requires interaction, often to feed materials to the machines as part of the manufacturing process itself, this counts as Worker Effort. Meanwhile, the latter is covered by Operating Costs.

This example illustrates the difference between *living labour* (represented by Worker Effort) and *dead labour* (represented by Material and Operating Costs). As we can see, living labour refers to what the workers here and now contribute to creating the commodity. Meanwhile, dead labour relates to things acquired, refined, or made outside the part of the production chain we're examining.

We've seen how mass production can make items, services, and each other more accessible throughout history. For example, with the advent of the printing press, books and pamphlets became more accessible to the average person. Likewise, the rise of the computer and the internet allows ease of communication across the globe in mere milliseconds.

There is hope that further automation will increase production, where an increase in supply usually fills demand quicker and results in prices lowering. However, there are also fears that it will replace human labour, putting many workers out of jobs. Meanwhile, introducing technology usually creates new jobs to maintain that technology. These factors all go hand in hand and give an insight into where the true source of profit arises.

I want to look at the source of profit and its calculation with some detailed examples. So we'll continue this examination in another post. For now, let's end with a summary of the terms we've looked at so far:

<dl>
  <dt>Commodity</dt>
  <dd>Something produced or provided as a service for sale on the market.</dd>
  <dt>Capital</dt>
  <dd>The things used towards the goal of generating profit. For example, money isn't necessarily capital until spent on something with the intent of generating profit.</dd>
  <dt>Use-value</dt>
  <dd>The particular use of a commodity, such as the eating of bread, to sate one's hunger.</dd>
  <dt>Exchange-value</dt>
  <dd>The ratio with which one commodity exchanges with another, based on the amount of value they each contain. For example, corn, iron, and currency.</dd>
  <dt>Socially necessary labour time</dt>
  <dd>The time required to produce something using the average degree of skill, intensity, technique and technology in society.</dd>
  <dt>Living labour</dt>
  <dd>The employed workers by the capitalist.</dd>
  <dt>Dead labour</dt>
  <dd>The things purchased for production, such as machinery and raw material.</dd>
</dl>
