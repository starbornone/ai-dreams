description: "With conflict seemingly on the horizon, Emily Vaughn reports to Layne Gerhardt. The likelihood of a powerful newcomer to the scene has Layne running through the possibilities. But, could the brewing trouble be as terrible as it seems? Or merely the paranoia of one who has played the game for too long?"

'Well?' Layne asked with the tired voice of someone who had endured enough for one day. He was a tall vampire with short brown hair, high cheekbones, a strong jawline, and a straight nose. Despite the many years spent wandering the earth, he had the appearance of one in their mid-thirties.

Watching Emily, his elbows rested on the tooled black leather writing surface of an ornate mahogany desk. It had a serpentine fronted top inlaid with floral marquetry and stood supported by cabriole legs ending in leaf sabots. The rest of the room followed the theme, furnished in similar 18th-century mahogany fashion. The walls were adorned with asymmetrically designed sconces mounted throughout with stylised leaf-tip motifs.

'Nothing with Janet or Martin,' Emily responded, hesitating for a moment. Against the wall to her right stood a secretary crowned by a carved and gilded cartouche with a floral ornament. Its mirrored doors reflected her figure in the dim light, two lit candles flickering in its pull-out candle holders.

'Looked like someone was following Olivia,' she continued. 'Someone old, perhaps an elder. Although possibly something older, from ancient times. I couldn't get a look at their face. A hood covered it. Maybe even a mask, too...'

'Ancient? Do you understand that which you suggest?' Layne asked, his voice raised ever so slightly.

'They seemed capable of suppressing their aura, but there were moments that it slipped.'

'Yes, that would make them an elder at least,' Layne stated quickly. His hazel eyes narrowed as he watched Emily, and he drew back into the mahogany chair. His lanky yet toned body pressed against the padded back, covered in red silk damask. 'Are you sure they didn't let it slip on purpose?'

'I can't say. I doubt they noticed me. I made sure to follow from a distance, but they disappeared.'

'I presumed as much,' Layne muttered pensively. Thoughts had already begun swirling within his mind. An elder on this continent marked a strange occurrence; it was simply too much of a modern wild west. Moreover, while elders managed the major cities, arguably only three, they rarely left to pursue their interests personally. So despite recent tensions opening up the possibility that one of the other two moved about this city, Layne focused on the alternative. An outsider, one who did not fit within the chaotic societal structure of this region.

The implications of this were many. None who fancied such a formidable home had been the kind to nurture the networks that the typical elder desired. Those left in the list of possible candidates for the mysterious stalker were few, although none welcome.

Furthermore, the possibility that they weren't an elder but something else remained. Layne's brows wrinkled almost imperceptibly as he sifted through the options in his mind. One stood out before the rest - Maia. She had promised her return over a century and a half ago. Could this be the avowed time?

'I should have searched harder. Followed better. Maybe even confronted them when I had the chance.' Emily ran her fingers over the secretary, above the cambered lower part with three drawers and lavish gold-plated fittings. She stared past the surface, seemingly lost in her own reflections and misgivings.

'In such a crowd, it should have been alright,' Emily added.

'Don't be a damned fool. They would have sought to kill you,' Layne snapped, broken out of his train of thought.

She slid the fingers of her left hand smoothly through her hair and sighed.  There was no consoling Layne, regardless of the angle. 'So why her?'

'Yes, what could they possibly want with her? Is she so significant? Or perhaps to get to me?' Layne wondered thoughtfully, not a question for Emily but instead asking himself. As much as those playing the political game did their best to keep their puppets secret, the matter of which human belonged to whom was often easy to uncover. Often, the reveal was part of the game itself - a nugget of truth to distract from larger stashes of veritable gold.

He soundlessly moved the chair back and walked towards the window, dressed with vibrant raspberry red and rust drapes. Matching lambrequins with stylised arch motifs and gold braided cord trims covered their tops. The windows they adorned were made of specialised glass, which blocks ultraviolet rays, allowing wealthy vampires some degree of security in their own homes.

'She knows half as much as the others. If that!' Layne concluded, turning towards Emily.

'She also talked to two of Shirley's cohorts.'

'And?'

'One of them told her about the rumours regarding the prince. That's all.'

'Now come on, they spoke with her simply to inform her of that?' Layne's patience waned. The young often missed details which, more often than not, ended up being the most significant. Nevertheless, Emily had consistently been more attentive and reliable than most.

'The rest was nonsense. Lim seemed curious, and Chen warned her to be careful. That's all.'

Layne's face darkened for a moment. 'They're working an angle, looking for something. She's nothing but a mortal, yet I cannot tolerate this affront.'

'It's probably nothing,' Emily replied, seemingly an attempt to dissuade his concerns, ignoring how little he desired reassurance.

'Don't you understand? The rumours are not myths; they have their grounds. Action has become inevitable. Should anything happen, whoever takes over will require someone to blame and deliver to final death. For them, it would be a calamity to waste such an opportunity on one who poses no threat.'

Emily seemed to consider his words. Layne, as an opponent, has always been a formidable adversary in the political world. Even before he came to this continent, his dealings had garnered him quite the reputation. However, one could legitimately send him to his death if there were reason to believe that he had orchestrated an assassination attempt against the prince. A situation where his reputation of having a penchant for underhanded tactics did more harm than good.

'Understood. I'll see what I can find out,' Emily concluded, taking a moment before turning to make her way towards the heavy mahogany door behind her.

'Whatever your next actions may be, I suggest you don't do anything stupid in their pursuit,' he called after her, to which she turned and gave a slight nod before leaving.

Once the door had closed, Layne sighed and pulled an ornate gold key from his inside left breast pocket. A delicately designed piece, it gleamed in the soft candlelight. He turned to the tier of three drawers with convex fronts, decorated with a shaped apron below, on the right side of his desk. The key fit the third drawer perfectly, and he pulled out a leather-bound folio.

It had never been wise to keep any sensitive data, whether digitally or physically. Often such information acted as a double-edged sword, potentially capable of dragging down multiple parties. The documents within this folio seemed innocuous, correspondence between two friends regarding their travels around the country. However, they could provide evidence that there had been a sort of mutual friendship at all. Maybe that was worth something to someone who would listen.

Perhaps these letters would have been more guarded in a privately owned high-tech facility containing safety deposit boxes. A few such locations existed in the city, one in particular which boasted of its "flexible and convenient operating hours - 24 hours, 7 days a week." For the longest time, it had been quite serviceable for several vampires, though none would admit it.

It made no difference, for Layne frankly couldn't resist keeping these close to his person. They caused him to feel something, yet even he had conceivably become incapable of determining the nature of such emotions. Perhaps he felt nostalgic for a time when he risked it all, performing a role in a contest against the older and purportedly wiser. But, of course, that would require admitting susceptibility to such whimsical fantasies. Remaining hidden behind the rationality of using these records as an advantage against others seemed wiser.

Amusingly enough, while vampires played numerous games against each other, often it became hard to tell whether they were also deceiving themselves in the process. At what point did masks become genuine reality? No, this was not the time to become sentimental and gain newfound self-doubt, Layne resolved. He folded the folio and took a moment to gaze at the cover before he slipped it into his black textured Saffiano leather briefcase and left the room.
