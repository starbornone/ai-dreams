## Bullshit Jobs: The Rise of Pointless Work, and What We Can Do About It

_David Graeber_

<div class="grid-3">
  <div class="grid-col-span-2">
<p>Be honest: if your job didn't exist, would anybody miss it? Have you ever wondered why not? Unfortunately, up to 40% of us secretly believe our jobs probably aren't necessary. In other words: they are bullshit jobs. This book shows why, and what we can do about it.</p>
<p>People prophesied that technology would see us all working fifteen-hour weeks and driving flying cars in the early twentieth century. Instead, something curious happened. Not only have the flying cars not materialised, but average working hours have increased rather than decreased. And now, across the developed world, three-quarters of all jobs are in services, finance or admin: jobs that don't seem to contribute anything to society. In Bullshit Jobs, David Graeber explores how this phenomenon - one more associated with the Soviet Union, but which capitalism was supposed to eliminate - has happened. In doing so, he looks at how, rather than producing anything, work has become an end in itself; the way such work maintains the current broken system of finance capital; and, finally, how we can get out of it.</p>
<p>This book is for anyone whose heart has sunk at the sight of a whiteboard, who believes 'workshops' should only be for making things, or who suspects that there might be a better way to run our world.</p>

## Capitalist Realism - Is there no alternative?

_Mark Fisher_

<div class="grid-3">
  <div class="grid-col-span-2">
<p>After 1989, capitalism has successfully presented itself as the only realistic political-economic system - a situation that the bank crisis of 2008, far from ending, actually compounded. The book analyses the development and principal features of this capitalist realism as a lived ideological framework. Using examples from politics, films, fiction, work and education, it argues that capitalist realism colours all areas of contemporary experience. But it will also show that, because of several inconsistencies and glitches internal to the capitalist reality program capitalism is anything but realistic.</p>

## The Dictator's Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics

_Bruce de Mesquita and Alastair Smith_

<div class="grid-3">
  <div class="grid-col-span-2">
<p>For eighteen years, Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith have been part of a team revolutionising the study of politics by turning conventional wisdom on its head. They start from a single assertion: Leaders do whatever keeps them in power. They don't care about the national interest", or even their subjects, unless they have to. This clever and accessible book shows that the difference between tyrants and democrats is just a convenient fiction. Governments do not differ in kind but only in the number of essential supporters, or backs that need scratching. The size of this group determines almost everything about politics: what leaders can get away with, and the quality of life or misery under them. The picture the authors paint is not pretty. But it just may be the truth, which is a good starting point for anyone seeking to improve human governance.</p>

## Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media

_Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky_

<div class="grid-3">
  <div class="grid-col-span-2">
<p>In this pathbreaking work, Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky show that, contrary to the usual image of the news media as cantankerous, obstinate, and ubiquitous in their search for truth and defense of justice, in their actual practice they defend the economic, social, and political agendas of the privileged groups that dominate domestic society, the state, and the global order.</p>
<p>Based on a series of case studies--including the media's dichotomous treatment of "worthy" versus "unworthy" victims, "legitimising" and "meaningless" Third World elections, and devastating critiques of media coverage of the US wars against Indochina--Herman and Chomsky draw on decades of criticism and research to propose a Propaganda Model to explain the media's behaviour and performance. Their new introduction updates the Propaganda Model and the earlier case studies and discusses several other applications. These include how the media covered the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and subsequent Mexican financial meltdown of 1994-1995, the media's handling of the protests against the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund in 1999 and 2000, and the media's treatment of the chemical industry and its regulation. What emerges from this work is a robust assessment of how propagandistic the US mass media are, how they systematically fail to live up to their self-image as providers of the kind of information that people need to make sense of the world, and how we can understand their function in a radically new way.</p>

## How Propaganda Works

_Jason Stanley_

<div class="grid-3">
  <div class="grid-col-span-2">
<p>Our democracy today is fraught with political campaigns, lobbyists, liberal media, and Fox News commentators, all using language to influence the way we think and reason about public issues. Even so, many of us believe that propaganda and manipulation aren't problems for us--not in the way they were for the totalitarian societies of the mid-twentieth century. In How Propaganda Works, Jason Stanley demonstrates that more attention needs to be paid. He examines how propaganda operates subtly, undermines democracy--particularly the ideals of democratic deliberation and equality--and how it has damaged democracies of the past. Focusing on the shortcomings of liberal democratic states, Stanley provides a historically grounded introduction to democratic political theory as a window into the misuse of democratic vocabulary for propaganda's selfish purposes. He lays out historical examples, such as the restructuring of the US public school system at the turn of the twentieth century, to explore how the language of democracy is sometimes used to mask an undemocratic reality.</p>
<p>Drawing from a range of sources, including feminist theory, critical race theory, epistemology, formal semantics, educational theory, and social and cognitive psychology, he explains how the manipulative and hypocritical declaration of flawed beliefs and ideologies arises from and perpetuates inequalities in society, such as the racial injustices that commonly occur in the United States. How Propaganda Works shows that an understanding of propaganda and its mechanisms is essential for the preservation and protection of liberal democracies everywhere.</p>
