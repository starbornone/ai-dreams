Candace reclined against a black leather sofa seated opposite William Chen, dressed in his usual dark slim-fit blazer. They sat a small space apart on a sumptuous black leather sofa, its back detailed with button tufting, squared-off by a minimal frame and chrome-plated legs.

Candace had the appearance of a young woman with an oval profile and light olive skin tone. A dark smoky eye with thick winged eyeliner and a sultry pink lip. Her lush dark golden brown curly hair draped across her shoulders, where two elegant straps held up a pure silk top. The gently flowing hemline and delicate lace detailing accentuated a slim, slightly athletic physique.

'Are they not a myth?' William Chen asked, narrowing his eyes slightly.

'Perhaps. Perhaps I found something very interesting and kept it in my apartment in the city. Come over sometime,' Candace suggested. 'I would like your input on it, and you're not the worst company.'

Candace turned her gaze toward tinted windows to her left, directly opposite the drapes, her almond-shaped, deep brown eyes narrowed as she looked down onto the floor below. From the other side, the thick glass panes appeared as mirrors, hiding those within and ensuring they could speak freely and remain unheard.

'I don't mind. We could...' William began.

'Hmm, who is that?' she asked quickly, interrupting him. Her gaze was fixed on a girl in a mini black dress with long sleeves and a surplice neckline. Despite the darkness, broken only by strobing lights, Candance could make out the pintucks and pleating through the waist on her dress as the girl made her way through the crowd.

William had leaned forward on an elbow, resting his chin on his palm. Now he drew up to follow her gaze across the room to see a familiar human girl walking towards the club's rear exit.

'Ah, Olivia,' he answered. 'Human. She's a timid one.'

He turned back to Candace and sighed as if he realised he had just made a mistake.

'Excuse me,' Candance announced and rose from the sofa before brushing past the sheer silken drapes, opening the heavy black metal door, and disappearing from William's view.

She caught up to Olivia just outside large metal doors leading to an alleyway.

'Hey, you must be new here,' Candace greeted her, lightly smiling with her lips together. 'We haven't officially met. I'm Candace.'

'Olivia.' The girl blinked, as though surprised to find someone address her directly.

'So what brought you here, Olivia? Are you a vampire groupie?' Candace asked playfully. She curled her fingers slightly beneath her chin, lightly stroking it with her first finger. A sculptural white gold snakehead ring on her ring finger glinted in the light, featuring banded sections of rubies set against black rhodium and white diamonds.

'I was just leaving, actually. I have work tomorrow,' Olivia replied, regarding the ring. A sizeable pear-shaped ruby sat atop the centre of the snake's head with small black diamonds for nostrils and rubies for eyes.

'Sorry, I suppose that was obvious since we're already outside,' she added apologetically. 'But, um, that's a beautiful ring.'

'Mm, thanks,' Candace replied, glancing at it herself before moving her hand to rest on her hip. 'So, the club. Not quite what you expected?'

'What do you mean?'

'You're leaving, are you not?' Candace asked, tilting her head slightly. 'This whole masquerade here seems a bit too modern, doesn't it? None of that romantic gothic style one would expect.'

'I guess this would be more popular.'

'True. Besides, a vampire pretending to be a human pretending to be a vampire? That's not avant-garde - it's just silly,' Candace said mockingly.

'Um,' Olivia managed to utter, a frown creasing her forehead. 'What brings you here?'

'Curiosity, I suppose. Morbid curiosity.'

'Same. I'm not sure what I'm looking for, though. Or even how to find it,' Olivia admitted, defeat tinging her voice.

'Well, we'll have to remedy that now, won't we? I should get back to my friends, though. Come around another time, we can talk, and I can fill you in on all the things I've learned. Some of us have to stick together, you know?'

'Okay, that would be nice. Thanks.' Olivia gestured goodbye with a slight wave, then gingerly turned and continued walking away. She wrapped her arms around her waist as she moved, as though to keep warm.

Candace sighed and followed Olivia from a distance, their shadows drifting across old sandstone buildings. She followed as Olivia walked to the nearest station, a couple of blocks away, ensuring to keep out of sight. They passed a man sleeping next to a cardboard sign with black marker text explaining his homelessness and expressing his hope for spare change. Then, they made their way down a set of dirty steps, avoiding a discarded paper fast-food bag laying on its side.

Ten minutes later, a train headed west arrived, sparsely populated with tired-looking passengers. They both boarded at opposite carriage ends, accompanied by one other lone soul dressed in a black leather jacket. The man, a well-built figure appearing in his early 40s, took a seat near Olivia and sat silently listening to music through earphones.

The three of them watched the city lights drift off into the distance behind them. The bright lights inside the carriage could not keep a couple of other passengers nearby from falling asleep. When Olivia finally alighted at her destination fifteen minutes and eleven brightly lit stations later, Candace continued to follow from the shadows.

She watched as Olivia left the brightly lit station, navigating through the station gates and out into the streets. Olivia made her way away from the late-night convenience stores and pubs, down darker roads lined with small apartment buildings and garbage bins awaiting garbage trucks in the morning. A black and white cat scurried between two buildings, staying low to the ground.

As Olivia turned off the sidewalk and onto the path of an apartment building three storeys tall, Candace dashed silently across the road. She stopped in front of the man in the black leather jacket she'd seen on the train, facing him with crossed arms.

'What do you think you're doing, hunter?' Candace asked the man. His dark brown eyes widened, a moment of fear flashed across his face.

'None of your business, vampire,' the man snarled in response, withdrawing a black double-edged dagger and steadying himself. The dagger's guard arms curved slightly upwards towards the blade, while a golden round medallion sitting at the centre of the guard lightly glinted in the dim light.

'Rude. You know it's not part of your doctrine to hunt humans,' Candace remarked with annoyed dismissal. The man seemed momentarily taken aback by her assertion. *Did he think Olivia is a vampire?*

'And what do you hope to achieve with that?' she asked, eyeing the blade.

Without another word, the man lunged towards her, his free arm held out across his front like a shield. She grabbed the arm and pulled him towards her, backing towards the brick wall to their side as she did so. As his body came hurtling towards her, so too did the black blade. Taking advantage of the momentum and his surprise, she reached out with her free hand. She grabbed his wrist, twisting it around and bringing it to pierce his chest as their bodies collided.

Sliding the blade out of his hand and gripping it in her own, she twisted it, still embedded in his chest, and he let out a muffled gurgle. His body fell limp towards her, seemingly gasping for breath. She pushed him to the side, letting him drop to the floor. Thick dark blood pooled on the concrete around his open wound, and his body twitched.

'Where did an amateur like you get something like this?' Candace asked, regarding the dagger in her hand. Scrollwork, filigree, and heraldry details decorated its hilt. Two smaller bronze circles sit embedded in the rounded handle, and a bronze-coloured cross adorned the round pommel.

'Now look what you've done. Got your blood all over me,' Candace scolded the body on the ground as she bent over to examine it. Then, searching his pockets, she fished out a slim black leather wallet, some keys on a brushed metal keyring, and a navy business card.

She glanced down the street to the apartment building Olivia had entered, noting that lights in a unit on the third floor were now lit, before stepping into the shadows and disappearing.
