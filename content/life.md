Ask not what your life can do for you, but what you can do for your life! Start here:

**"True freedom is impossible without a mind made free by discipline"**, and **"the first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself."** I desire not to be lead by the nose through life but to make a concerted effort to determine who I am through well-thought-out actions. Happiness is not necessary - the only life of deep satisfaction is a life of eternal struggle, especially with ourselves.

**"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing."** I aspire to refine my ability to engage my learning and curiosity by extending materialism to critique all matters of life. That is, historical materialism to interpret history, dialectical materialism to understand science and nature, and fill the gap between social ("soft") sciences and physical ("hard") sciences to interpret things considered "subjective" in the same way as natural events. We eventually could and therefore ultimately should decipher all remnants of subjectivity in our world.

**"The task of philosophy is not to provide answers, but to show how the way we perceive a problem can be itself part of a problem"** and **"discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought."** I wish to strive towards thinking beyond what we currently know and discover that we do not yet know, nor yet know that we do not know.

**"The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it."** As I discover and learn, I desire to strive to enact change with what I have learned. However, we should not aim to change individuals, but the system which pushes people into doing evil things.

**"Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."** If I am to put my effort into creating something, it should be worthwhile using measures beyond consumerism. It is not worth producing something merely entertaining that does not comment on, criticise, or otherwise have a deeper layer to it. Jokes can bring a moment of joy into another's life, so there's no need to dedicate more resources than that to such simple ends.

**"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much."** Collaborative efforts have been the backbone of achievement in humankind's history, so where possible, I should help and allow myself to receive help from others.

**"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."** When helping others, I should attempt to do so in a long-term fashion. Temporary fixes and supportive feelings may be necessary for the short-term, but never at the expense of the long-term.

**"Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people"** and **"words are never 'only words'; they matter because they define the contours of what we can do."** Talk is as valuable as the content of the conversation and can be beneficial to all parties involved if they engage genuinely. It would be wise to match my conversational effort proportionate to that received - it's alright that not everyone can contribute, yet time and effort are precious.

**"There comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but he must take it because conscience tells him it is right."** Do what is right, not what is easy, for my actions define me. The person I will be in the future results from the subject matter I consume, the activities I put effort into, the people I surround myself with, and how I react today. After all, **"Life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it."**

**"I gave myself permission to make mistakes. I wouldn't ever give myself permission not to try."** Success in these matters is not constantly adhering to the rules but doing my best to follow them and correcting myself when necessary. Needing to infallibly follow one's principles to the letter to be allowed to have such beliefs is idealistic nonsense - I should not let such "criticisms" be deterrents from working towards my goals.
