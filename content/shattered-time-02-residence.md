The click of Olivia's black heels echoed off drab concrete floors and walls. Her tiered short black dress swayed with each step, a small black clutch in her left hand. She walked down a dim hallway lined with people attired in minidresses and collared shirts, past a large sign that read 'RESIDENCE', each letter illuminated by fluorescent red lights. Uptempo hi-NRG Eurodance powered by bass beats, synthesisers, a snarling keyboard, and guitars flowed through a heavy metal door.

Olivia snaked her way in and passed the bar, a thick swarm of people versus four bartenders all dressed in black. Yet despite being in such a loud and crowded scene, the discomfort she felt remained hidden by her swift movements. She weaved her way up a flight of sleek metal stairs with an open gap between the treads - her hands gently held the layered fabric of her dress against the back of her thighs.

At the top, she found a glass railing overlooking the entire dancefloor to lean on and peered around. Bodies grooved in the shadows to the steady-rocking dance track, illuminated in waves by colourful lasers, strobes, and spotlights.

Olivia pulled up an app on her phone, 'Noteworthy'. A white caret gently flashed on the screen as Olivia's fingers hovered over the onscreen keyboard. The app was the first she had made since graduating, and she used it almost daily. She focused on security over convenience in its creation, from how data was encrypted and stored to how notes could be organised and hidden. Where better to store her discoveries on the intricacies of the vampiric world?

Olivia patted her thumbnail against the screen a couple of times then froze. Her standing position by the railing made her crossed legs feel stiff, out of place and jumbled up. Her ears twitched, and gooseflesh dotted her arms. The uncomfortable feeling of being under the watchful gaze of another washed over her, more intense than she'd ever felt.

Olivia ordinarily assured herself that it was merely her own fear. An imagined fear of being the subject of another's interest, causing her to feel something that wasn't actually happening. For what possible reason could anyone have to actually want to look at this girl?

'Olivia!' a voice called out over the music. She turned to see two familiar figures reclined in nearby stylish banquette seating and sighed, almost relieved despite them both being vampires but not really.

'Oh, Will,' she muttered. William Chen was Olivia's height with medium length black hair, styled precisely according to the latest trend. He sat up straight and began arranging his slim black tie and sleek blazer, catching the attention of the other vampire who seemed to comment. In large, irregularly cut mirrors covering the entire wall, their reflections mimicked their movements. The music shifted to a Europop, electronic dance-style beat, and a couple of cheers rose above the sound.

Olivia regarded the lights from the dancefloor flicker across the mirrors as she walked towards the vampires. Her body felt uncooperatively stiff and cumbersome; the short distance suddenly seemed far away. The disquiet of hidden eyes following clung to her and made her aware of every moment. It continued even when the two vampires before her weren't watching. Weary that her advance conveyed the awkwardness she felt -  no longer sure of how to move her arms by her side - Olivia quickened her pace. She zigzagged between the other patrons as the pulsating, synth-injected dance track thumped in the background, making it difficult to not match steps with the beat.

'Happy Thursday, Liv,' Daniel Lim remarked, his white teeth bared in a broad grin, fangs visible. Although seated and with his black hair spiked up, it was clear that he was taller than them both. His skin was a darker, more typical southern Chinese tan than his companion's, and his dress style was more simplistic. A slim silhouetted long-sleeved grey knit adorned his upper half with the edges of a white t-shirt peeked out from underneath the v-neck. Perhaps a wardrobe decision to emphasise his presentation as one who frequented the gym at least twice a week.

He raised his lowball glass with a clear liquid, a large cube of ice, and a tiny purple sphere inside it. As he did so, the face of a gold-toned watch with chain link bracelet on his wrist briefly reflected a ray of light, its three chronograph sub-dials barely visible. 'Man, you should try one of these. I have no idea what the fuck it is, but it's pretty good.'

William shot his companion an unimpressed expression and turned to Olivia. He smiled with a closed mouth and clasped his hands together on the table in front of him. 'Hi. What brings you back here?'

'Um, I need,' Oliva murmured as she reached into her clutch and pulled out a business card. 'Some things.'

She placed the card on the table and pushed it over to Daniel. 'It's eerie in here tonight. Feels like someone's watching me.'

'Who wouldn't be? In that dress. Right, Will?' Daniel smirked, entertaining himself, not breaking eye contact with Olivia. She glanced at Will, who stared intently at Daniel.

Daniel covered the card with his right hand and dragged it towards himself. He flipped it over it for a glance and quickly slid it into his pocket. He grinned, fangs showing. 'I didn't know that was your thing, bro.'

'It's, I'm not,' she stuttered. 'I just...'

'It's alright,' William interrupted. 'It's been a while since we last saw you. Be careful. Especially now. I'm sure you've heard?'

'What do you mean? Heard what?' Her voice raised in pitch more than she had hoped.

'You're an excitable one tonight, aren't you?' Daniel questioned as he sat forward, not quite asking as much as stating. He rested his elbows on the table and his chin on clasped hands.

'Some believe the Ordo have more power here than they're supposed to and that it's because of a certain someone you know quite well,' William explained. 'It's come to the point that some are considering doing something about it.'

'Yeah, man. There are rumours that the Revolutionary Council wants to kill your sire,' Daniel added.

'Dangerous words.'

'No stranger to betrayal, are we?' Daniel asked. The corner of his mouth twitched in the slightest smirk and a devilish gleam in his eyes.

William pressed his lips together. His face, inanimate as a statue, yet something changed - his dark brown eyes bore through her into some unknown expanse beyond. All at once, Olivia felt tiny in his presence, enveloped by an oppressively heavy aura. Even the music blurred in the background, the high register of the vocalist obscured into the beat.

Daniel thoughtfully watched William as though with mere curiosity. His drink hovered near parted lips but didn't quite make contact.

'In any event, it's dangerous for one within that circle.'

'Maybe I should make my way home,' Olivia mused aloud. She felt a sudden chill, recalling the feeling of eyes following her, and goose-flesh pimpled her bare arms. She ran her hand slowly up and down her left arm, eyes scanning the club.

'Had enough of these chart-topping pop tracks for one night?' Daniel asked, reclining back, raising his right arm and resting it along the back of the seating. 'Yeah, they suck. But they're like catnip for you pretty young things.' He winked, running the tip of his tongue over one of his top canines in mock display.

Daniel downed the last of his drink, throwing his head back in a swift movement almost too quick for Olivia to follow. He slammed the glass back down on the table, the ice cube rattled around.

'We shouldn't keep you. Good evening, Ms Merritt,'  William said, completely ignoring the other vampire. He blinked and focused his eyes on Olivia, his demeanour softened, and his words sounded more genuine.

'Fair,' Daniel added, raising his glass in a simulated toast to Olivia. 'You know where to find me if you need anything else, man.'

Olivia scanned the crowds one last time, unsure of what she was searching for, before gesturing farewell to the two vampires.

'Bro, don't tell me you fancy another human,' Daniel joked before Olivia had strayed far. 'Don't you have enough already?'

William glared back, only for Daniel to grin and laugh. Then, realising she had paused a moment to turn her head and listen, she swiftly continued into the swarm of people towards the exit.
