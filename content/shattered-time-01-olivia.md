description: "The veil which hid an underlying supernatural world no longer shrouds Olivia Merritt's eyes. Nevertheless, her view of the real world barely scratches the surface. Thus begins her story of trying to survive as both a human struggling to overcome her past, and a puppet of forces much older and more powerful than she could imagine."

'Okay.' Olivia peered into the counter surface, seeing nothing. She felt her heartbeat in her chest, a steady rhythm that reverberated down through her limbs. If she didn't keep her hands firmly planted in her lap, there would be nothing to hide her hands shaking. 'But what do I...'

'Look. All you need to do is go to the office,' Emily interrupted. The vampire had the bearing of a slim but shapely young woman. Turning, she moved with unearthly grace and crossed her arms. 'Let them know why you're there, and they'll let you go wherever you need to. No one will suspect anything.'

Silence lingered. It hung in the air as the fog on the early morn, a dense cloud that felt heavy on the breath.

Emily was pretty, Olivia confessed to herself as she took note of her features, mindful to not meet eyes. Lush honey-coloured hair fell lightly across her shoulders, adorned with a white v-neck silk blouse, a cross over wrap detail across the front. Her large almond-shaped blue-green eyes stood out against her beautiful pale light skin, with a small dusting of freckles across her cheeks and nose. Perhaps a tinge of jealousy lined Olivia's thoughts. She'd never look so feminine and beautiful.

'Okay,'  Olivia spoke, the joints of her thumbs rubbing forcefully over each other. She glanced up for a moment before casting her eyes towards the floor.

'Good. Get it done, report to me afterwards. You know the drill,' Emily said quickly, eyes narrowed.

The vampire lingered for a moment, staring at Olivia. Her brows drew together ever so slightly, and quiet fell over the room. Olivia's curiosity got the better of her, and she raised her eyes to meet Emily. Hollow eyes stared down at her.

'It's important that you are thorough and don't leave any traces,' Emily added. 'Your skill with this is why you're still an asset. It's your only advantage.' Then the vampire turned lithely, grabbing her long coat that laid across the back of the sofa, and moved towards the door.

When the front door finally clicked closed, Olivia sighed and wistfully moved to the window. She stared at her dull reflection on the glass, studying herself. Dark brown hair fell straight down to her waist, with side bangs framing a strong jawline. She ran her fingers along her lower jaw, from ear to chin, and dropped her head a touch, changing how the shape of her jawline appeared in the reflection. Her skin was smooth and soft, porcelain in colour, and her figure slim. Gazing at her chest, she speculated that perhaps she was a little too thin.

*Well, some would disagree*, Olivia thought. Her mind wandered to the modest two-storey house she recently occupied. She shared a second-floor room with another, connected to a small balcony facing the street she never stepped foot on. She recalled the carpeted stairway from that room and how it spiralled down to the living room with its tiled floors and heavy front doors with frosted windows.

She had fond recollections of that place, admittedly. Of sitting in a doorway late at night, talking to the younger sister, remarking how she had been much more rational and introspective than her sibling. Of baking cupcakes with her and decorating them with goofy designs. And of costuming up for an event that had not yet caught on in their country. They did it nevertheless and roamed the city, having humorous conversations with strangers. None of those sentimental memories involved the older sibling, the one Olivia had shared a bed with.

But one night, those heavy front doors closed behind her for the last time. Olivia had walked away with bags full of as much as she could carry and never once glanced back. Feeling a pit growing in her stomach, she shook her head as if doing so could possibly shake away those thoughts. It wasn't that Olivia harboured any ill will towards the young man with whom she spent that term. Although leaving lifted an enormous weight off her chest. For a season, shame burdened her for the role that she played. Her crimes were those of not having the courage to end it, staying due to guilt and fearing the consequences of any alternative, permitting it to drag on for so long. And possibly most of all, she felt remorse for being so damn miserable.

However, Olivia's gut now turned in concern for no longer feeling anything towards those memories. What was she becoming if the indiscretions of her past actions didn't disturb her? Could she be developing into a monster akin to those from her past? It was nothing short of a horrifying thought, and they had all been human. What influence might the immortals in her life now have?

Suddenly, remembering that the next day would be Friday, Olivia grabbed her phone from the desk beside her. The pit in her stomach deepened with a pang of new restlessness. She found her way to the messenger app and tapped on the onscreen keyboard:

'Hey! I know we were meant to catch up tomorrow, but I had to finish off this project by tomorrow night, and I don't think I can make it on time. Can we do something next Thursday instead? Sorry! :('

Outside the window, autumn was in full swing. A great tree, the tips of its branches caressing the window, swayed gently as a light rain pattered on its broad leaves. Others, changed by the season into shades of golden, orange, and red, lined the streets, dimly illuminated in yellow by tall streetlights. The people walking by outside protected themselves from the chilly evening and drizzling rain with jackets, scarves, and colourful umbrellas. Sometimes their laughter wafted its way through the window.

Olivia observed them, puzzling over whether they had any clue the world they lived in had another supernatural dimension underneath it. A layer that involved creatures a rational person believed only existed in fiction, despite having plagued popular culture in varying waves for centuries. Not that her own personal experience yielded much. It had been nigh on half a year since Emily's sire, Layne Gerhardt, had found Olivia. He and Emily Vaughn together had opened Olivia's eyes to this world. They enlisted her as someone who would aid their cause, whatever it may have been.

At any rate, the information shared by either of those two vampires had thus far been sparse. She had already met some others who had been infinitely more revealing in their knowledge. Despite this, it all culminated in Olivia not really knowing anything substantial at all.

From what Olivia could gather, there indeed was some kind of vampire societal structure dictating who governed whom, how they conducted themselves, and so on. Rising in rank would, therefore, give a vampire more power to command others of their kind. However, with status came more enemies, resulting in intense paranoia, the further one climbed. It seemed to occur in such a manner that the desire for security created an even greater need for security, perpetuating a neverending cycle of deception and scheming in the name of survival. Puppets of all kinds would act out their parts, yet they lived only as long as their existence posed no threat in exposing the identity of their puppeteer. As for how any of this played out or the concrete rules and hierarchy, how they interacted with each other, and any further fine details, Olivia had no clue.

From Olivia's individual standpoint, mainly Emily arrived knocking on her door with the actual errands. The ensuing conversations regularly ended up quite the same. Emily's impatience aside, Olivia was quite sure that the vampire resented her. If anything, she imagined Emily probably would much rather keep her chained up like cattle in the depths of some dungeon, available for anyone to drink from as they pleased. Why would they desire an outsider such as herself for an extended period? She struggled to ascertain if they were testing her for a more significant future role or if it was another purpose entirely. Something, at least, to explain why she wouldn't end up as a liability in need of immediate scrapping. Perhaps her confusion was simply wishful thinking.

A vibration drew her attention back to the phone where a new message had popped up:

'Don't worry! :D We'll do something next week. Good luck with your project! What's it for?'

Her eyes welled, and a single tear slipped down her cheek.
