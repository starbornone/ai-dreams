## title: About Me

This blog is where I explore how external forces often influence our beliefs, choices, and actions—sometimes benefiting them more than us. Through critique, reflection, and exploration, I aim to spark deeper thinking about the world we live in, especially when it comes to questioning the status quo.

## So, who am I?

I'm just another person navigating life on this planet—probably a lot like you. I make a living designing and coding for the web. I'm based on the east coast of Australia, where Christmas is warm and winters are mild. But there's more to my story than lines of code and coastal living.

My journey hasn't been a straight path. For a long time, I grappled with feelings and challenges that didn't quite add up. It wasn't until recently that I started **[Understanding My Mind After Decades of Misdiagnosis](https://www.aidreams.world/posts/understanding-mind-decades-misdiagnosis)**. Discovering that I had ADHD was a turning point. It explained so much—the restless energy, the hyper-focus on projects, the periods of burnout.

Navigating life with ADHD, especially during a global pandemic, has been a rollercoaster. In **[COVID-19, ADHD, and Everything In Between](https://www.aidreams.world/posts/covid-adhd-everything)**, I delve into how these challenges collided. The pandemic forced many of us to confront aspects of ourselves we'd long kept at bay. For me, it was a catalyst for deeper introspection and growth.

When I'm not behind a screen, I'm usually immersed in books—both fiction and non-fiction—or exploring games, whether digital or tabletop. Game design and programming aren't just hobbies; they're passions that fuel my curiosity and creativity. My diet? Let's just say it's heavily powered by noodles, rice, and an alarming amount of tea. And despite living by the coast, I'm not a fan of sand or salty air—go figure.

Reflecting on my life, I've realised the importance of self-awareness and continuous growth. In **[Reflecting on My Life: The 2022 Edition](https://www.aidreams.world/posts/reflecting-life-2022-edition)**, I share some major revelations that have shaped who I am today. It's been a journey of unlearning old patterns and embracing new perspectives.

## Why am I sharing all this?

Because I believe in the power of reflection and shared experiences. Writing helps me organise my thoughts and make sense of the chaos around—and within—me. I firmly believe that words can shift perspectives, even if it's just by offering a new idea or sparking a moment of contemplation.

**My 10 Rules for a More Fulfilling Life** are principles I've developed to navigate the complexities of existence. They're not about achieving perfection but about striving for balance and understanding. You can read more about them [here](https://www.aidreams.world/posts/10-rules-fulfilling-life).

**[My Journey to Being Here](https://www.aidreams.world/posts/journey-here)** chronicles the winding path that led me to this point. It's been filled with twists, turns, and a fair share of obstacles. But each experience has contributed to the person I am today—someone who's continually learning and evolving.

## What can you expect from this blog?

This space is a collection of thoughts, musings, and explorations into various facets of life. Whether it's dissecting societal norms, delving into philosophical questions, or sharing personal anecdotes, my goal is to engage with complex ideas in an accessible way.

I often ponder how our minds work, especially after my own experiences. By sharing my story, I hope to shed light on the importance of self-advocacy and the journey toward self-discovery.

## Why "AI Dreams"?

You might be wondering about the name of this blog. It's a nod to the intersection of technology and humanity—a play on the question of whether androids dream, inspired by Philip K. Dick's novel _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_ Just as that book explores the blurred lines between the artificial and the real, I aim to examine the often unnoticed influences shaping our perceptions and lives.

## Join me on this journey

I invite you to explore, question, and reflect alongside me. The world is a complex place, and sometimes it helps to have a companion in thought. Whether you're here to find new perspectives, challenge old ones, or simply satisfy your curiosity, I'm glad you've stopped by.

If you're not sure where to start, the **[Best of AI Dreams](https://www.aidreams.world/pages/best)** is a curated selection of posts that capture the essence of this blog.

At the end of the day, I'm just someone trying to make sense of the world. Writing is my way of piecing together the puzzle, one thought at a time. I hope that by sharing my experiences and reflections, I can offer something of value to those who pass by.

Thanks for visiting. Here's to questioning the norm and exploring the depths of thought.
